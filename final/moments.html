          Edgar Martinez's iconic double hit in Game 5 of the 1995 ALDS remains etched in baseball history.
          It was a moment that defined his legacy, as he delivered a clutch, game-winning hit against the New York
          Yankees. With the bases loaded in the bottom of the 11th inning, Martinez's swing connected, sending the ball
          down the left-field line, allowing Ken Griffey Jr. to dash home, securing the Mariners' victory and propelling
          them to their first-ever American League Championship Series. This unforgettable play solidified Martinez as a
          hero in Seattle and a legendary figure in baseball folklore.</p>
