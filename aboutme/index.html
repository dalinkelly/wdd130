    <h2>Dalin Kelly</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am Dalin Kelly and I am from Puyallup, Washington. I really enjoy both watching
    and playing sports with friends. I also enjoy the outdoors and love to hike and backpack.
    Being from Washington, there are a lot of beautiful hiking spots but one of my favorites
    is to go near Mount Rainier to go hiking.</p>
    <p>I am currently studying Business Analytics with a minor in Software Management. I have
    enjoyed studying both of these areas and I hope to one day land a job that allows me to 
    help make decisions for a company based on their previous data. One company that I would
    like to work for is Dell.</p>
    <p>I look forward to this class and I cannot wait to get to know you! Thank you for viewing
    my web page!</p>
